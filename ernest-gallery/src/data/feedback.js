        text: "I ordered a oil painting from portrait-painting.com for the first time. At first, I was a little bit sceptical. But, I am glad that I did. What made me nervous was that I wanted a painting of an air plane that I used to fly in the Military years ago. I did not see any examples of air planes on their website, so I made the leap and gave it a try. I was very impressed with the quality that came out. It is exactly the way I wanted it. I thought the prices were extremely reasonable. You can have your most treasured photos transformed into an oil painting.",
